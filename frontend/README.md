# Food Spot App
The Food Spot app is for people with certain intolerances 
(milk and/or gluten-containing foods).
It allows app users to quickly select restaurants and caf√©s,
when they are on the move. For example on vacation or when you visit friends
in a city and you don't know what kind of food and drinks are offered there.... :)
